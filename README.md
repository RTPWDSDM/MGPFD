# MGPFD (Multi-Goal Path Finding Dataset)
This is a dataset for multi-goal path finding problem, including a training dataset and a simulation dataset.


************Training Dataset************
    - For learning-based methods (like S&Reg[1]) to solve the MGPF problem
    - Including promising region segmentation, guideline prediction, and length regression
    - Details of the learning-based methods refer to [1]
    
    
    
************Simulation Dataset************
    - For test the performance of MGPF algorithms
    - Including seen scenarios and unseen senarios
    - parts of unseen scenarios stem from [2]
